# AI vs Real Image Classifier with CNN

This project is a simple CNN built as a practice exercise to deepen my understanding of the foundations of recommendation algorithms. There is a lot that I had previously learn about two years ago that I am refreshing by doing this project, similar to numerous other previous in-class machine learning projects I have done. I go into more analysis on my own code and my own observations (rather than just following an assignment's requirements).

The dataset used in this project is not included in the repository due to its large size (which was very difficult to deal with). You can download the dataset from the following link:  
[CIFAKE: Real and AI-Generated Synthetic Images](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/victorsoeiro/manga-manhwa-and-manhua-dataset/data)

Disclaimer: this is slightly unfinished and in works, behind the scenes. Hopefully I will have time to finish the write up and analysis to share but I will have more information about results, using transfer learning, how different popular networks work on this dataset, what to be taken away from this lesson etc.
